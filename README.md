# Project-Euler-1-mul-of-3-and-5-ada
My solution to the project Euler problem multiples of 3 and 5 using the ADA programming language which is similar to C++ 

The prompt is
if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
